## Demo Access

Visit `/ckeditor-demo` in your application to see:
- CKEditor in action
- Usage examples
- Code snippets
- Best practices

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Implementation**: Visit the demo page to ensure everything works
2. **Customize as Needed**: Modify `ckeditor.js` for custom toolbar configuration
3. **Add to Existing Forms**: Use `richText()` or `ckeditor()` methods in your forms
4. **Style Customization**: Modify `ckeditor.css` for custom appearance
5. **Advanced Features**: Consider custom CKEditor builds for additional functionality

## Browser Support

CKEditor 5 supports:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Performance Notes

- CKEditor is loaded only when needed (when textarea has `data-ckeditor` attribute)
- Bundle size increased by ~1.4MB (includes all CKEditor features)
- Consider code splitting for production if bundle size is a concern

## Security Considerations

- CKEditor content contains HTML - always use `{!! !!}` (unescaped) when displaying
- Consider HTML purifier for additional content sanitization
- Validate content length and content on server side
- Be aware of XSS risks with user-generated HTML content

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify CKEditor is properly loaded in the page source
3. Check the comprehensive guide at `CKEDITOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
4. Test with the demo page at `/ckeditor-demo`
